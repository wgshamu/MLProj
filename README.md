# MLProj
Small ML project I made, it's not functional since I've refrained from uploading anything with personal data. Contact me for more information about the project.

Some notes about my process.
A lot of the data was gotten by crawling through yahoo, it was a pretty rudimentary crawler, since all it did was look for the site name and download the data.
The data was run through a splitter that is NOT by my own creation. So this sorts the data into all the different variables that are being used my ML.
This ML software was more of a test to see if I could do it, I've run a lot of tests on the ML software, and the different tests are wildly different in success.
The software itself has 3 different tests, mostly to see how much data is required before it starts being unsuccessful.
I'd be willing to show some more of the software if you have any questions about it! Due to (privacy concerns) I'm not going to upload the whole thing, but I can show the data I have, as well as some of the results I get.
